## Ecommerce website

My thought process

#### 1. Features
  - __Unauthenticated users__
    * view product pages
    * search for products
    * add to shopping cart
    * login
    * register
  - __Authenticated users__
    * all unauthenticated user's features
    * order (available only when shopping cart is not empty)
    * after products are received can leave a comment and a review (through
      email)
    * wishlist (products that the user wants to track for later purchase)
  - __Admin__
    * django admin page

#### 2. Database structure
  - __See resources folder__

#### ?. Tests

#### ?. Security
